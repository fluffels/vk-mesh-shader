# Geometric Grass Via Mesh Shader Example

## Advanages

1. Culling before geometry generation.

## TODO

1. Make grass field infinite by taking modulo of eye position in shader.
2. Make grass bendy.
3. Randomly rotate grass around the Z axis.
4. Vary grass colour according to noise texture.
5. Add wind.
6. Blend between 0 and green with a more S-shaped curve.
